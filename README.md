# Continuous go

Long enough have we suffered under the constraints imposed upon us by the grid of intersections. Down with the grid of intersections!

## Reasoning behind this

None. This is a terrible idea.

## Inspiration

The idea might be bad, but it is not even original.

## Rules

1. You know [how to play go](https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go/).
2. These two stones are not adjacent (TODO: show a kosumi).
3. Stones which are closer than that are adjacent.
4. Most of the rest of the standard go rules apply (TODO: ko???).
